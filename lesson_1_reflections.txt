How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I can lookup what changed in the code recently and determine the reason of the bug.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
History tells me when a file was created and how it reaches to the state it is currently in.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Autocommits would make it difficult to analyse the history later on. Manual commits contains more contextual information.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
While working on Google Docs users are usually working on a single file at one time unlike software programs where multiple files are involved.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
